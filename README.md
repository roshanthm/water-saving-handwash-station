# 🚰 Water-Saving Hand Wash Station  

## 🔎 Problem Statement  
In public places like bus stops, schools, hospitals, and tourist spots, traditional taps often waste water because people leave them running while soaping their hands.  

Automatic sensor taps exist, but they require **electricity or batteries**, which makes them expensive and less practical in rural or outdoor environments.  

There is a strong need for a **low-cost, electricity-free, water-saving solution** that works anywhere.

## 💡 Proposed Solution: Foot-Pedal Operated Tap  
The **Water-Saving Hand Wash Station** is a **mechanical system** where the water flow is controlled by a **foot pedal** instead of a hand-operated tap.  

- ✅ Water flows only when the pedal is pressed.  
- ✅ Water stops instantly when released.  
- ✅ No electricity or batteries required.

## ⚙️ Working Principle  
1. The foot pedal is mechanically connected to the water valve using a lever or spring system.  
2. Stepping on the pedal **opens the valve** → water flows.  
3. Releasing the pedal **closes the valve instantly** → no wastage.  
4. Entirely **manual, power-free, and low-maintenance**.

## ✅ Advantages  
- **100% Mechanical** – Works without electricity or batteries.  
- **Water Saving** – Prevents wastage while soaping; saves up to **50–60% water** compared to normal taps.  
- **Hygienic** – No need to touch the tap with dirty hands → reduces spread of germs.  
- **Low-Cost & Durable** – Simple construction, easy to install, minimal maintenance.  
- **Eco-Friendly** – Reduces water wastage, sustainable for large-scale use.

## 🌍 Applications  
This system is highly suitable for:  
- 🚍 **Public bus stops & railway stations** – Ensures clean handwashing facilities with no wastage.  
- 🏞️ **Tourist places & parks** – Saves water in high-usage areas.  
- 🎓 **Schools & colleges** – Teaches students sustainable water use.  
- 🏥 **Hospitals & clinics** – Hygienic and water-efficient.  
- 🌱 **Rural areas / power-cut prone areas** – Works without electricity.
